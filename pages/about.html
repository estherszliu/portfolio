                            My Previous Career
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            In my previous career, I worked as a chef in some great fine dining spots in Darwin and Brisbane, like Peewees at the 
                            Point and French Restaurant Harves. About a year ago, I decided to switch things up and became a barista at a local 
                            caf√© in Brisbane. This change gave me the chance to dive into the world of coffee, honing my skills in making the perfect 
                            cup and offering top-notch customer service.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Moving from the kitchen to the coffee counter was a big shift, but it gave me a fresh perspective on the hospitality 
                            industry. Now, as a barista, I'm focused on the art of coffee making, blending my cooking skills with a keen eye for 
                            detail. Every day, I enjoy interacting with customers, ensuring they have a great experience, and paying attention to 
                            the little things that make a big difference. This change shows my adaptability and commitment to doing my best in any 
                            role within hospitality.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Looking back on this journey, I'm excited to use my wide range of skills for future career opportunities. This experience 
                            has not only broadened my expertise but also sharpened my approach to delivering great service. I'm eager to bring my 
                            skills and enthusiasm to the tech industry in the next chapter of my career.

                            My Hobbies
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Beyond my professional endeavors, I find immense joy in pursuing my culinary passions as a hobby. Cooking and baking 
                            have become integral parts of my life, allowing me to explore creativity outside the structured kitchen environment. 
                            In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with flavors, textures, and presentations, often creating delectable desserts 
                            that are a visual and flavorful treat.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Whether it's crafting the perfect cake or experimenting with savory delights, my kitchen is my creative sanctuary. 
                            The process of transforming raw ingredients into something beautiful and delicious fuels my passion. I love the 
                            satisfaction of seeing an idea come to life and the joy it brings to others. These culinary endeavors, captured in 
                            images, reflect the heart and soul I pour into my hobby outside the professional realm.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This love for creativity and attention to detail spills over into everything I do, reinforcing my dedication to 
                            continuous improvement and excellence, whether in the kitchen or any new venture I undertake.
