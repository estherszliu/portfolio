                            My Previous Career
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            In my previous career, I served as a chef in notable fine dining establishments in both 
                            Darwin and Brisbane, contributing my culinary expertise to Peewees at the Point 
                            and French Restaurant Harves. About a year ago, I underwent a slight career transition, 
                            stepping into the role of a Barista at a local caf√© in Brisbane. This deliberate move allowed 
                            me to delve into the intricacies of coffee craftsmanship, refining my skills in precision and 
                            customer service.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This transition represented a calculated shift from the culinary realm to the nuances of 
                            coffee culture, offering a unique perspective within the hospitality industry. In my current 
                            role, I am dedicated to the art of coffee preparation, seamlessly integrating my culinary 
                            proficiency with a heightened attention to detail. This professional evolution underscores 
                            my adaptability and steadfast commitment to achieving excellence in the dynamic hospitality 
                            landscape.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Reflecting on this transformative journey, I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set in 
                            anticipation of future professional opportunities. This experience has not only expanded my 
                            expertise but has also cultivated a refined approach to delivering exceptional hospitality 
                            experiences. I look forward to contributing my skills and knowledge to the ever-evolving 
                            dynamics of the tech industry in the chapters that lie ahead.

                        <p>
                            Beyond my professional endeavors, I find immense joy in pursuing my culinary 
                            passions as a hobby. Cooking and baking have become integral parts of my life, 
                            allowing me to explore creativity outside the structured kitchen environment. 
                            In my free time, I enjoy experimenting with flavors, textures, and presentations, 
                            often creating delectable desserts that are a visual and flavoursome treat. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Whether it's crafting the perfect cake or experimenting with savory delights, 
                            my kitchen is my creative sanctuary. The process of transforming raw ingredients 
                            into something beautiful and delicious fuels my passion. These culinary endeavors, 
                            captured in images, reflect the heart and soul I pour into my hobby outside the 
                            professional realm.
